I'm using here alternatively Visual Studio Code, cause JetBrains PyCharm Community edition does not support working with Jupyter-Notebooks (however the paid Professional version does).
For Downloading the PyCharm Community Edition just hit the button "Download PyCharm now" and scroll the next site down to find download-buttons for <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">free</mark> Community Edition.
There is also Web-base JupyterLab that can be used as well.
